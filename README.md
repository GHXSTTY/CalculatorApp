# CalculatorApp

I have a while learning C# but never did my first "Original" project.
So two days ago I decided to build my first own project, a basic Calculator app.
I'm not too proud of it because I watched a tutorial before doing it and googled too much but anyway...
I plan to continue working on it, perhaps adding more functions, change the UI etc...

This is the version 1.0.
